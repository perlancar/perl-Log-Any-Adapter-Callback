Revision history for Log-Any-Adapter-Callback

0.08    2014-02-28 (SHARYANTO)

	- No functional changes. Rebuild and depend on Log::Any::Adapter instead
          of Log::Any::Adapter::Util which is now excluded from CPAN index
          [GH#3]. Thanks Amiri Barksdale.


0.07    2013-11-12 (SHARYANTO)

	- No functional changes. Rebuild to fix t/00-compile.t generated by
	  older DZP::Test::Compile (2.019 < x < 2.033).


0.06     2013-09-26 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add missing test dependency to Test::More 0.98
           (pointed out by Clinton Gormley) (weird, lint-prereqs doesn't catch
           this).


0.05     2013-09-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of
           Module::Build because the latter is deprecated from core in 5.19.


0.04    2012-03-13 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Support older Perl [RT #75719].

        - Only call callback if level suffices.


0.02    2011-05-11 (SHARYANTO)
