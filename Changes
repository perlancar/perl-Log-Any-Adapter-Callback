Revision history for Log-Any-Adapter-Callback

0.06     2013-09-26 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add missing test dependency to Test::More 0.98
           (pointed out by Clinton Gormley) (weird, lint-prereqs doesn't catch
           this).


0.05     2013-09-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of
           Module::Build because the latter is deprecated from core in 5.19.


0.04    2012-03-13 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Support older Perl [RT #75719].


0.03    2011-10-24 (SHARYANTO)

        - Only call callback if level suffices.


0.02    2011-05-11 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - Some rewording in POD.


0.01    2011-05-11 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release.
